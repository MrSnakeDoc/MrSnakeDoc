## About Me

Backend & Platform Engineering specialized in **Go** , focused on performance, clarity, and maintainability.  
Strong DevOps mindset: I design **clean backend architectures**, automate infrastructure, and validate everything inside a real-world **homelab environment**.  
Currently exploring **Kubernetes**, **infrastructure as code**, and **cloud-native operations** to bridge backend development with scalable deployments.  
I also maintain and contribute to OSS projects focused on developer tooling and backend platforms.

## Homelab & Infrastructure

I design and operate a self-hosted environment with:

- Docker & Proxmox for containerized services  
- Traefik reverse proxy with automated TLS  
- Cloudflare Tunnels for secure remote access  
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards  
- AdGuardHome for DNS and filtering  
- Synology NAS for storage, backup, and VPN  
- DevOps stack: Gitea, Drone CI, Uptime Kuma, Gotify, Mealie, Outline, Homepage  

> Everything runs on **Proxmox** today; migration to **Kubernetes (K3s)** is underway.

## Highlighted Projects

- [**Navire**](https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/navire):<br/>
  ***Ongoing OSS project aiming to become a distributed multi-channel notification orchestrator built in Go.***<br/>
  Designed around a **Core + Dispatch** architecture with an agnostic **pub/sub transport** (starting with Redis Streams), **multi-channel adapters** (Slack, Gotify, ntfy, Discord, and more planned), and an **observability-first** approach.<br/>
  The project will be **open-sourced** once the `v0.0.1` MVP is complete and ready for release.

- [**Keg**](https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/keg):  
  ***CLI tool* to *bootstrap* and manage a local development environment with Go.**<br/>
  Automates ZSH, Homebrew, and packages setup. Persistance via a YAML config file.

- [**homelab-blueprint**](https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/homelab-blueprint):  
  A documented architecture for self-hosted services on Proxmox, Docker, and Traefik. Includes monitoring, networking, and access control.

- [**dotfiles-blueprint**](https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/dotfiles-blueprint):  
  Opinionated, modular dotfiles with sane defaults, focused on productivity and minimalism.

- [**Goslaw**](https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/goslaw):  
  A Go library for functional operations on slices, inspired by JavaScript's array methods. Provides a fluent API for common slice manipulations.
